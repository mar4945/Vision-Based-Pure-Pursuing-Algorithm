# Vision-Based-Path-Following-Algorithm

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts for the work carried out for IFAC2020 MATLAB Minidrone competition. The algorithm was the [winner of the competition](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/student-competitions/minidrones/minidrone-masters.html). 

The instructions to set up the simulation scenario are available at [this link](https://it.mathworks.com/academia/student-competitions/minidrones.html), while the preprint and final version of the paper are [available on Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351443447_A_Vision-Based_Algorithm_for_a_Path_Following_Problem) and [IEEE eXplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9476777), respectively.
