# Vision-Based-Path-Following-Algorithm

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts for the work carried out for IFAC2020 MATLAB Minidrone competition. The algorithm was the [winner of the competition](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/student-competitions/minidrones/minidrone-masters.html). 

The instructions to set up the simulation scenario are available at [this link](https://it.mathworks.com/academia/student-competitions/minidrones.html).
